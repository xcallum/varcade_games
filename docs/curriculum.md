In the pages that follow we will explore a range of different topics related to software engineering.

Hardware, software, coding and of course work on a real world project.

A combination of reading and doing.

The menu on your left will provide you with reading material that covers various different software engineering related topics as well as detailed guides on how to work with Varcade Games, along with some tasks for you to do yourself.

## What you will need

In order to work with Code Over Time you will need a computer, an internet connection and time. 

### Computer

You will not be able to follow this material on a tablet or phone, you will need a desktop or laptop computer. A PC or a Mac will do fine.

### Internet

All of the content is online and you will need to download and install a number of different pieces of software.

### Time

There are no shortcuts to learning how to program a computer, you will need to put in the time. It's also worth remembering that an hour per day is far more valuable than one 5 hour marathon session per week. Consistency is key.

It's worth thinking about your motivations now. If you are looking to learn enough about coding to get a well paid job as quickly as possible then Code Over Time is not for you. 

If, on the other hand, you want to learn how to build software and are willing to put in the time - then this is definitely the right place for you.

## Reading Material

This section covers many different but important topics related to computers and software engineering.

Some of it technical, some of it more philosophical. 

The goal here is to help you really understand what is actually going on inside your computer and to get you thinking like a software engineer.

## Your Internship

This section is all about Varcade Games.

How to set up your development environment, how to configure the product and how to make changes.

This is where you will experience what it is like to be a software engineer out there in the real world.

## An important Note

This will be an ever-evolving curriculum. 

The project will grow and shift over time and new reading material will be added.

You will find this is exactly what happens in the software industry. 

Nothing is static - and you will need to get used to that fact pretty quickly.

## What's next?

I recommend jumping straight in to your internship.

The 'Getting Set Up' and 'Onboarding' documentation will guide you through the process of downloading the project code and running it on your machine.

As soon as you start that process you will be learning.

If you get frustrated or want a break from the hands on side of things then jump over to the reading material.

If you want some human support you can join me over on our dedicated [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/kCpFSeEx).

Most importantly - have fun!
