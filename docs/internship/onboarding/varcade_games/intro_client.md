# Introduction

At this point you should be pretty familiar with Varcade games from a user perspective.

Now it's time to start looking beneath the surface to understand how is all actually works.

In this section we will go through the architecture of the system, try and understand what is happening from the perspective of the browser, make some code changes and run some tests.

Up until now we've been getting things set up but from here on out... we're engineering.

## Notes 

From this point on you will have to start exploring and finding your own way around. 

As I've said before, this is the most effective path for learning, so keep the following in mind:

* Be curious - ask questions, think about what you're seeing/experiencing and why it does/doesn't make sense
* Don't be afraid to get lost in the code
* Don't be afraid to make changes break things
* Don't worry if you don't understand something (there will be plenty you won't understand, that's why we're here - to learn)
* You **can** do this - but like everything worthwhile, it's going to take time and effort
