We're about to venture deep into the server side of things...

Server development can be intimidating for a number of reasons:

* No real visual indicators of progress (like with UI development)
* There are a lot of pitfalls and challenges to deal with
* There are a lot of concepts to learn beyond coding
    - Networking
    - Infrastructure
    - Security
    - Scalability
    - Data management
    - Data consistency

We will touch all of those things to some degree, but don't get bogged down in all of that just yet. 

Let's instead focus on how we connect two players together for a nice game of Rock Paper Scissors.

All of the code of this module lives in `game_rps/server/game_server`, so open it up in your text editor/IDE and lets get started.
