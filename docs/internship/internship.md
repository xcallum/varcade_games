# Your Internship

Welcome to your own personal internship.

In this section you will go through a rite of passage that all engineers must go through when they find their first job.

First you must set up your **Development Environment**.

This is the process of taking a computer and installing all of the software that you will need in order to actually working on the project you've been hired to work on.

I won't lie - this can be tedious and annoying. Often times the process is poorly documented and engineers tend to do it once and forget the steps, so when someone new comes along things will be broken and people won't have answers as to why. Furthermore, software ages - new versions of programs and operating systems are released all of the time and the combination of software versions on your computer might combine in just the right way to may sure that nothing works as expected on your machine.

The reason I'm telling you all of this is that you know **it's not just you**. You are not an idiot. Sometimes things and just hard and annoying. But we persevere, learn and eventually get through it.

Once your development environment is setup we will move on to **Onboarding**.

Onboarding is the process of learning how to work on a project. The idea is to 'get on board'.

In our case you are free to focus on the areas that are of most interest to you.

If you are interested in frontend development, web tech or graphics then you can spend most of your time working on those aspects of Varcade Games.

If you want to experience the dark art of server side development you can focus on that.

Onboarding is general - it will give you a broad exposure to everything. It will give you enough information to actually start making changes to the code and seeing what happens.

Once you get there you are ready to actually start working on the project. This means:

* Fixing bugs
* Cleaning up code
* Building new features
* Writing tests

At this point you can call yourself a software engineer!
