# What do I do now?

The answer to that question is entirely up to you I'm afraid.

If you'd like to add a real game that you can play to your Game Portal then open up the README for the `game_rps` project. It will guide you through the specific settings you need to do that.

The onboarding section of this site will guide you through the overall system design and also provide more insights into specific areas of the project and the code. 

It covers topics like:

* The system architecture
* The structure of the various different projects
* How to test the various different systems
* How to make changes and see the impact in real time

Unless you've already got experience working on a moderately sized project like this, I think the onboarding course is a great next step.

If you are more experienced and confident then I'd recommend just jumping into the code and trying to figure out how everything works.

Regardless of your choice, I really hope that working with Varcade Games is a great learning experience and helps you grow as an engineer.

Good luck!
