## Docker

In order to run Varcade Games on your Mac you will need to install Docker for Mac. 

Follow the [official guide](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/) to get it set up.

## Developer Tools

You will also need some standard developer tools. 

To get these you can install XCode directly from the Apple app store, or you can download from the [developer downloads](https://developer.apple.com/downloads/index.action) (login required).

If you've ever done any development on your Mac you've likely installed this stuff already.

## Git

You will also need 'Git' (source control) for getting access to the code. Again, if you've done any development you likely have Git on your system already - but if not, don't worry - you can follow the official install instructions [here](https://git-scm.com/download/mac).

You can check if git is installed already by typing `git --version` in your terminal (to open your terminal press CMD + Space, then type `terminal`, then hit enter).

You should see some output that looks like this:

```
git version 2.31.1
```

That's about it. Let's test our setup - head over to [the guide for doing that](../testing_your_setup/).
