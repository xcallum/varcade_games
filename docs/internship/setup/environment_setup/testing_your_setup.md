# Testing your setup

At this point you should have Docker up and running, which means you can now run the Docker image that was included in the zip you downloaded to begin with.

## Linux and MacOS

Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
docker --version
```

If docker is up and running you should see some output similar to this:

```bash
Docker version 20.10.11, build 485636f
```

## Windows

On windows you will need to open Powershell, if it's not already open then run:

```bash
docker --version
```

If docker is up and running you should see some output similar to this:

```bash
Docker version 20.10.11, build 485636f
```

If you did not see this, then it's time to start investigating - but don't worry, there is opportunity here. Learning how to deal with environment specific issues when setting up / working with a project is *essential* for every software engineer.

If you can't get to the bottom of the issue yourself you can go ahead and create and [issue on the Github Repo](https://github.com/Code-Over-Time/varcade_games/issues).
